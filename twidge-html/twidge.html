>Description</H2
><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN

      <A
HREF="http://twitter.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Twitter</A
> and
      <A
HREF="http://identi.ca/"
TARGET="_top"
>Identica</A
> (identi.ca).
      Microblogging sites let you post short one-paragraph updates,
      follow the updates that your friends post, and interact with
      everyone in the site in a conversation style.
    </P
><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> is a client to make working with microblogging sites
      faster and easier.  It is extremely versatile, and can be
      customized to work the way you want to work, and combined with
      other tools to do just about anything.
    </P
><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> can be used quite nicely interactively from the shell.
      It is useful directly as-is, and with simple shell aliases can
      make a highly efficient system to do exactly what you want.  It
      is perfectly capable of being your only client for
      microblogging.
    </P
><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> also can be used in an automated way, via
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cron(1)</B
>, or it can even integrate with your
      email system.
    </P
><P
>      A full list of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN

      suggestions on how to use it, can be found at the <SPAN

>Quick Start</H2
><P
>      This section will describe how a first-time <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> user can
      get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> compiled or installed on your system.  If not,
      please follow the instructions in the
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>INSTALL</TT
>
      file in the
      source distribution.
    </P
><P
>      To get started, simply run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge setup</B
> at your
      shell prompt.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> will lead you through the first-time
      configuration -- which is very quick and completely
      self-explanatory!
    </P
><P
>      Now, let's start exploring.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge lsrecent
      -su</B
> will show you the 20 most recent updates from the
      people you follow.  After the first time, it will remember what
      you've seen and only show you new updates.  In place of
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lsrecent</B
>, you could substitue
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>lsreplies</B
> to replies to you.  You can also
      run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge lsrecent --help</B
>, or refer to this
      document, for more details on the command.  In short, -s tells
      the system to save what you've seen, and -u tells it to only
      show you unseen items.
    </P
><P
>      You can subscribe to updates from friends by running
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge follow
      <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>nick</I
></TT
></B
>.  To subscribe to
      updates for <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>twidge</SPAN
> itself, you'd run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge follow
      unixtwidge</B
>.  If you've had enough of updates from
      someone, just use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge unfollow</B
> command.
    </P
><P
>      Now, how about posting your own updates?  Just type
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>twidge update</B
>.  Type your update, and press
      Enter when done.  Your update may scroll past the end of the
      screen; don't worry about it.  Just don't hit Enter until you're
      done.  You can also pass your update on the command line, taking
      care to quote it if it contains spaces or shell characters.

>        If your connections must go through a proxy, you'll need to
        set an environment variable.
        If you use an
        environment variable, your settings may will also impact other
        applications -- and that's probably what you want.  See the
        Environment section later for tips on doing that.

      However, it does pass on the environment to the
      programs it calls, such as Curl.  This can be useful for
      specifying proxies.  Please see
