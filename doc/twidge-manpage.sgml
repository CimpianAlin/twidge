    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      &twidge; is a client for microblogging sites such as 
      <ulink url="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://identi.ca/">Identica</ulink> (identi.ca).
      Microblogging sites let you post short one-paragraph updates,
      follow the updates that your friends post, and interact with
      everyone in the site in a conversation style.
    </para>
    <para>
      &twidge; is a client to make working with microblogging sites
      faster and easier.  It is extremely versatile, and can be
      customized to work the way you want to work, and combined with
      other tools to do just about anything.
    </para>
    <para>
      &twidge; can be used quite nicely interactively from the shell.
      It is useful directly as-is, and with simple shell aliases can
      make a highly efficient system to do exactly what you want.  It
      is perfectly capable of being your only client for
      microblogging.
    </para>
    <para>
      &twidge; also can be used in an automated way, via
      <command>cron(1)</command>, or it can even integrate with your
      email system.
    </para>
    <para>
      A full list of &twidge; features, along with numerous
      suggestions on how to use it, can be found at the &twidge;
      website at <ulink
      url="http://software.complete.org/twidge"></ulink>.
    </para>

    <title>Quick Start</title>
    <para>
      This section will describe how a first-time &twidge; user can
      get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
      &twidge; compiled or installed on your system.  If not,
      please follow the instructions in the
      <filename>INSTALL</filename>
      file in the
      source distribution.
    </para>
    <para>
      To get started, simply run <command>twidge setup</command> at your
      shell prompt.  &twidge; will lead you through the first-time
      configuration -- which is only two questions and completely
      self-explanatory!
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, let's start exploring.  <command>twidge lsrecent
      -su</command> will show you the 20 most recent updates from the
      people you follow.  After the first time, it will remember what
      you've seen and only show you new updates.  In place of
      <command>lsrecent</command>, you could substitue
      <command>lsreplies</command> to replies to you.  You can also
      run <command>twidge lsrecent --help</command>, or refer to this
      document, for more details on the command.  In short, -s tells
      the system to save what you've seen, and -u tells it to only
      show you unseen items.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can subscribe to updates from friends by running
      <command>twidge follow
      <replaceable>nick</replaceable></command>.  To subscribe to
      updates for &twidge; itself, you'd run <command>twidge follow
      unixtwidge</command>.  If you've had enough of updates from
      someone, just use the <command>twidge unfollow</command> command.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, how about posting your own updates?  Just type
      <command>twidge update</command>.  Type your update, and press
      Enter when done.  Your update may scroll past the end of the
      screen; don't worry about it.  Just don't hit Enter until you're
      done.  You can also pass your update on the command line, taking
      care to quote it if it contains spaces or shell characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      That's the quick tour.  For many more examples, refer to the
      website.

    <para>
      &twidge; always is invoked with the name of a specific
      operation, such as <option>update</option> or
      <option>add</option>.  In &twidge;, these operations are
      called <emphasis>commands</emphasis>.  Each command has its
      own options, which are given after the command on the
      &twidge; command line.  A full summary of each command's
      options is given later in this manual.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      You may obtain a list of all commands with <command>hpodder
        lscommands</command>.  Help is available for any individual

      All commands support the command <option>--help</option>.  Running

        This can be useful if you want to stop following a podcast for
        awhile, but think you may want to come back to it in the

        new episodes, then download any pending episodes.

      <para>
        The <command>settitle</command> is used to manually set the
        title of a given podcast.  Normally, &twidge; will
        automatically get the title from the podcast's XML feed.
        Sometimes the XML feed for the podcast may not provide a
        useful title.  In those situations, you can use
        <command>settitle</command> to manually override the title.
      </para>
      <para>
        Please note that if you want to set the title to a name that

      <para>
        The update command will cause &twidge; to look at each
        podcast feed.  It will download the latest copy of the feed
        and compare the episodes mentioned in the feed to its internal
        database of episodes.  For any episode mentioned in the feed
        that is not already in the internal database of episodes,
        &twidge; will add it to its database and set its status to
        Pending.

    <title>Specifying podcast IDs</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Podcasts</><secondary>IDs</></>
    <para>
      Each podcast in &twidge; gets a numeric ID.  This ID is
      automatically assigned by &twidge; and is not changable.  The
      ID is given out when a podcast is added with the
      <command>add</command> command, or with the
      <command>lscasts</command> or <command>lsepisodes</command>
      commands.
    </para>
    <para>
      The ID is designed as a constant way to refer to a particular
      podcast.  A podcast's title may change, or even its feed URL,
      but the ID of a podcast will never change.  It also is short and
      easy to type on the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
      Several commands can take a list of podcast IDs.  If no IDs are
      given, the commands will default to operating on all podcasts.
      One or more IDs can be given, separated by spaces.  If IDs are
      given, then the commands will operate only on the podcasts with
      the given IDs.
    </para>
    <para>
      The special keyword <option>all</option> may be given, which
      tells the system to operate on all podcasts.  This yields the
      same result as giving no IDs at all.

    <title>Automatic Error Handling</title>
    <para>
      For whatever reason, podcast feeds or individual episodes sometimes
      fail to download.  The reasons for this range from the podcast being
      taken down by its author to the network being disconnected from the
      local computer.
    </para>
    <para>
      People that track many podcasts over a long time will probably find it
      annoying to have &twidge; attempt to download invalid feeds or
      episodes over and over again.  For that reason, &twidge; 1.0.0
      introduced automatic error handling.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once a podcast feed or episode has failed at least 15 times, 
      it's been at least 21 days since the first download attempt (episodes)
      or last update (feeds), &twidge; will automatically mark the item to
      be skipped in future runs.  For podcast feeds, &twidge; disabled the
      podcast; this status will appear in <command>hpodder lscasts</>.
      For episodes, &twidge; sets the status to Error; this will appear
      in <command>hpodder lseps</>.  Both can be changed later, with
      <command>hpodder enable</> or <command>hpodder setstatus</>,
      respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default minimums of 15 attempts and 21 days may be adjusted in
      the &twidge; configuration file, either globally or on a per-podcast
      basis.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you wish to disable checking entirely, you can put lines such as
      <literal>epfaildays = 123456789</literal> and
      <literal>podcastfaildays = 123456789</literal> in your <literal>DEFAULT</>
      section in <filename>~/.hpodder/hpodder.conf</>.  Of course, if you
      have podcasts that still fail after 338,237 years, you could be in

    <para>
      In this example, you saw some "general" options, such as

    <para>
      Whenever &twidge; looks for information about a particular
      podcast, it first checks to see if it can find that option in a

      answer, it consults its built-in defaults.

    <para>
      In this example, all podcasts share the same naming scheme.  All

          These options govern what types of files are processed in
          different ways.  The types used here are MIME types.  They
          will be the actual type determined by
          <option>gettypecommand</option>, or if that command is
          unable to determine a useful type, the MIME type given by
          the podcast's RSS feed.  Items in these lists are to be
          separated by commas.

                This is the comma-separated list of MIME types on
                which <option>postproccommand</option> will operate.
                The special single token <literal>ALL</literal> means
                to operate on all types.  To disable post-processing
                entirely, you can set this to the empty string.
                The default is: <literal>audio/mpeg, audio/mp3,
                x-audio/mp3</literal>

                This option governs the automatic renaming of
                downloaded files.  Some servers do not present files
                with proper extensions to match their file type.  This
                can confuse various software and devices.  &twidge;
                can automatically fix up extensions on such files.
                Each entry in the list in a MIME type, a colon, and
                the desired filename suffix.  Note that no whitespace
                is allowed around the colon.

    <title>Curl Configuration File</title>
    <para>
      Internally, &twidge; uses the Curl application to perform
      downloads across the Internet.  Curl is a remarkably flexible
      application, and &twidge; takes advantage of that to provide
      you with quite a few options.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can customize Curl as much as you like by creating a Curl
      configuration file in <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename>.
      Please see <application>curl</application>(1) for more details
      on the content of that file.
    </para>
    <para>Some things you can do with this file include restricting
    the maximum download rate, suppressing or adjusting the progress
    meter, configuring proxies, etc.

      Here are a few tips and hints to make &twidge; more pleasant
      for you.

      <title>Going Through a Proxy</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Proxy</><secondary>Using with hpodder</></>
      <para>
        If your connections must go through a proxy, you have two
        options: set an environment varilable or configure the proxy
        in your <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename>.  If you use an
        environment variable, your settings will also impact other
        applications -- and that's probably what you want.  See the
        Environment section later for tips on doing that.

      <title>Limiting Your Download Speed</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Download Rate</><secondary>Limiting</></>
      <para>
        Sometimes, you may not want &twidge; to use all of your
        available bandwidth.  Perhaps you don't want it to slow down
        other activities too much.  To do this, just create a
        <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename> file.  Put in it
        something like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting>limit-rate=20k</programlisting>
      <para>
        This will limit the download rate to 20 KB/sec.
      </para>
      <para>
        This rate limitation is imperfect and may not do well during
        <command>update</command>, but it should do exactly what you
        want during <command>download</command>.

    <title>Environment</title>

    <para>
      &twidge; does not read any environment variables directly.
      However, it does pass on the environment to the
      programs it calls, such as Curl.  This can be useful for
      specifying proxies.  Please see
      <application>curl</application>(1) for more details.
      As specified in the Per-Podcast Command Options section, &twidge;
      will also set certain variables for post-processing of
      downloaded files.
